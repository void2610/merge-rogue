## Core Architecture

### VContainer Dependency Injection System

The project uses a hierarchical VContainer setup with multiple LifetimeScopes:

#### LifetimeScope Hierarchy
```
RootLifetimeScope (DontDestroyOnLoad)
├── TitleLifetimeScope (TitleScene)
└── MainLifetimeScope (MainScene)
```

#### RootLifetimeScope
- **Purpose**: Manages globally shared services that persist across scene transitions
- **Services**: 
  - `IInputProvider/InputProviderService`: Input system management
  - `CursorConfiguration`: Cursor texture and hotspot data
- **Lifecycle**: Persists throughout application lifetime with `DontDestroyOnLoad`

#### TitleLifetimeScope
- **Purpose**: Title scene-specific services and components
- **Services**:
  - `ICreditService/CreditService`: Credit text management
  - `ILicenseService/LicenseService`: License information display
  - `IVersionService/VersionService`: Version number display
  - `IGameSettingsService/GameSettingsService`: Audio settings and seed management
  - `IVirtualMouseService/VirtualMouseService`: Virtual mouse for gamepad support (Scoped)
  - `IMouseCursorService/MouseCursorService`: Custom cursor management (Scoped)
- **Components**: `TitleMenu`, `Encyclopedia`

#### MainLifetimeScope
- **Purpose**: Main game scene services (future expansion planned)
- **Current Services**:
  - `IVirtualMouseService/VirtualMouseService`: Virtual mouse for gamepad support (Scoped)
  - `IMouseCursorService/MouseCursorService`: Custom cursor management (Scoped)
- **Planned Services**: GameManager, MergeManager, InventoryManager integration

#### Service Lifetime Management
- **Singleton**: Services that maintain state across the scope's lifetime
- **Scoped**: Services that are recreated for each scene (used for scene-specific resources)
- **Key Pattern**: VirtualMouseService and MouseCursorService use `Lifetime.Scoped` to ensure proper GameObject reference management across scene transitions

### Singleton Manager Pattern (Legacy)
- `GameManager`: Central state machine (Merge → EnemyAttack → AfterBattle → LevelUp → MapSelect)
- `UIManager`: Canvas group management and navigation
- `MergeManager`: Physics-based merge mechanics
- `InventoryManager`: Ball spawning and collection (10-slot fixed array)
- `RelicManager`: Power-up system with dynamic effects
- `StageManager`: Procedural map generation
- `EnemyContainer`: Battle system management

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **EventManager**: Central event system using R3 ReactiveX
- **GameEvent<T>**: Custom typed event wrapper with subscription/triggering
- **ReactiveProperty<T>**: Automatic UI data binding for health, coins, experience
- Event flow: Input → Effect → EventManager → StatusEffects/Relics → Apply

### Component-Based Entity System
- **BallBase**: Abstract base with 18+ specialized types (NormalBall, BombBall, etc.)
- **EnemyBase**: Base enemy with AI behavior via EnemyActionData
- **RelicBase**: Effect system with Init() → SubscribeEffect() → EffectImpl() pattern
- **IEntity**: Simplified interface for status effects with Dictionary<StatusEffectType, int> management

### Status Effect System
- **StatusEffectProcessor**: Static class managing all status effect logic via switch statements
- **Dictionary-based**: Uses `Dictionary<StatusEffectType, int>` for memory-efficient stack management
- **Centralized Logic**: All 10 status effects (Burn, Shield, Freeze, etc.) processed in single class
- **Data-Driven Timing**: StatusEffectTiming enum controls when effects trigger (OnTurnEnd, OnDamage, OnAttack, OnBattleEnd)

### Data-Driven Design
All game content uses ScriptableObjects with reflection-based instantiation:
- **BallData**: className, attacks[], sizes[], weights[], rarity, localization keys
- **RelicData**: className, sprite, rarity, localization keys
- **EnemyData**: sprites[], actions[], stats, AI parameters

## Key Systems

### Merge System
- Physics-based collision detection with Rigidbody2D
- Same-rank balls merge into next rank
- Serial number system prevents merge conflicts
- Freeze/Unfreeze mechanism during spawning

### Ball System
- 3 levels per ball type with scaling stats
- Override `Effect(BallBase other)` and `TurnEndEffect()` for custom behavior
- Level-based color coding system

### Relic System  
- Composition-based effects that subscribe to game events
- Dynamic loading via `Type.GetType(className)`
- UI integration with count display and interaction

### Status Effect Processing
- **Burn/Regeneration**: Turn-end damage/healing based on stack count
- **Shield/Invincible**: Damage absorption and immunity systems
- **Freeze**: Probability-based action skipping (stack × 10%, max 90%)
- **Confusion**: Player-only cursor control disruption during merge
- **Shock**: Enemy-only chain damage to other enemies
- **Curse**: Player-only disturbance ball generation
- **Power/Rage**: Attack modification (additive vs multiplicative)

### Localization
- Unity Localization package with Google Sheets integration
- Naming convention: `{className}_N` (name), `{className}_D` (description)
- Supported languages: English, Japanese

## Development Workflow

### VContainer Service Development

**Creating New Services:**
1. Define interface in `Assets/Scripts/System/Services/`
2. Implement service class with proper constructor injection
3. Register in appropriate LifetimeScope
4. Use `[Inject]` attribute for MonoBehaviour dependency injection

**Service Registration Patterns:**
```csharp
// Pure C# service
builder.Register<IMyService, MyService>(Lifetime.Singleton);

// Service with parameters
builder.Register<IMyService, MyService>(Lifetime.Singleton)
    .WithParameter("paramName", paramValue);

// MonoBehaviour component
builder.RegisterComponentInHierarchy<MyComponent>()
    .AsSelf()
    .AsImplementedInterfaces();
```

**Dependency Injection Patterns:**
```csharp
// Constructor injection (pure C# services)
public MyService(IDependency dependency)
{
    _dependency = dependency;
}

// Method injection (MonoBehaviour components)
[Inject]
public void InjectDependencies(IMyService myService)
{
    _myService = myService;
}
```

### Creating New Content

**New Ball Type:**
1. Create BallData ScriptableObject in `Assets/ScriptableObjects/BallData/`
2. Implement ball class inheriting from BallBase in `Assets/Scripts/Ball/`
3. Add to AllBallDataList asset
4. Add localization entries to string tables

**New Relic:**
1. Create RelicData ScriptableObject in `Assets/ScriptableObjects/RelicData/`
2. Implement relic class inheriting from RelicBase in `Assets/Scripts/Relic/`
3. Add to AllRelicDataList asset
4. Add localization entries to string tables

**New Status Effect:**
1. Add new enum value to `StatusEffectType` in `Assets/Scripts/Enums.cs`
2. Add case statement to appropriate method in `StatusEffectProcessor.cs`
3. Create StatusEffectData ScriptableObject with timing configuration
4. Add localization entries for effect name and description

### Code Patterns

**VContainer Service Registration:**
```csharp
// In TitleLifetimeScope or MainLifetimeScope
builder.Register<IGameSettingsService, GameSettingsService>(Lifetime.Singleton);
builder.Register<IVirtualMouseService, VirtualMouseService>(Lifetime.Scoped);
builder.RegisterComponentInHierarchy<TitleMenu>();
```

**VContainer Dependency Injection:**
```csharp
// Constructor injection for services
public GameSettingsService(IInputProvider inputProvider)

// Method injection for MonoBehaviours
[Inject]
public void InjectDependencies(IGameSettingsService gameSettingsService)
```

**Manual Service Resolution (Fallback):**
```csharp
// In SetMouseCursor.cs pattern for components that need manual resolution
private VContainer.Unity.LifetimeScope FindChildLifetimeScope()
{
    var allScopes = FindObjectsByType<VContainer.Unity.LifetimeScope>(FindObjectsSortMode.None);
    
    foreach (var scope in allScopes)
    {
        // Skip RootLifetimeScope (DontDestroyOnLoad)
        if (scope.gameObject.scene.name == "DontDestroyOnLoad") continue;
        
        // Find scope with required service
        if (scope.Container != null && scope.Container.TryResolve<IMouseCursorService>(out _))
        {
            return scope;
        }
    }
    
    return null;
}
```

**Event Subscription:**
```csharp
EventManager.OnPlayerDamaged.Subscribe(damage => { /* effect logic */ }).AddTo(this);
```

**Status Effect Management:**
```csharp
// Add status effect
StatusEffectProcessor.AddStatusEffect(entity, StatusEffectType.Burn, 3);

// Process turn end effects
await StatusEffectProcessor.ProcessTurnEnd(entity);

// Check specific conditions
if (StatusEffectProcessor.CheckFreeze(enemy)) return; // Skip action
```

**Data Access:**
```csharp
var ballData = ContentProvider.Instance.GetBallData(className);
var component = gameObject.AddComponent(Type.GetType(ballData.className));
```

**UI Navigation:**
```csharp
UIManager.Instance.EnableCanvasGroup("WindowName", true);
```

## Build Notes

- WebGL builds use custom template in `WebGLTemplates/`
- Uses Addressable Assets for content management
- NuGet packages may require manual setup after Unity version changes
- Localization assets are bundled with Addressables system

## Performance Considerations

- Object pooling patterns used for inventory management
- Composite Disposables for automatic R3 subscription cleanup
- Physics-based systems require careful performance monitoring
- UI uses DOTween for smooth animations without blocking gameplay
- **VContainer Optimization**: Scoped services ensure proper cleanup and recreation for scene-specific resources
- **Service Lifetime Management**: Careful balance between Singleton (global state) and Scoped (scene-specific) lifetimes

## Development Tools

### Unity Tools

Located in `unity-tools/` directory, these are simple and focused tools for Unity development workflow:

#### unity-compile.sh

A lightweight script for Unity compilation management with only two essential functions:

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Check current compilation errors
./unity-tools/unity-compile.sh check .

# Trigger Unity Editor compilation
./unity-tools/unity-compile.sh trigger .
```

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Error Detection**: Analyzes Unity Editor.log for current compilation errors only
- **Compilation Triggering**: Sends Cmd+R to Unity Editor via AppleScript to trigger recompile
- **Recent Log Analysis**: Checks only the latest 100 lines to avoid stale error messages
- **Simple Interface**: Two commands only - `check` and `trigger`

**Output Examples:**

Success:
```
📋 Checking Unity log: /Users/user/Library/Logs/Unity/Editor.log
✅ No recent compilation errors detected
📝 Last compile status: CompileScripts: 1.603ms
```

Errors detected:
```
📋 Checking Unity log: /Users/user/Library/Logs/Unity/Editor.log
❌ Recent compilation errors found:
Assets/Scripts/Example.cs(11,9): error CS0103: The name 'NonExistentMethod' does not exist in the current context
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Simplicity**: 89 lines vs. previous 657 lines (86% reduction)
- **Accuracy**: Only analyzes recent log entries to avoid false positives
- **Speed**: Minimal overhead with focused functionality
- **Reliability**: Robust error detection patterns for Unity Editor logs

**Requirements:**
- macOS (for AppleScript compilation triggering)
- Unity Editor must be running for `trigger` command
- Unity Editor.log must be accessible for `check` command

This tool enables efficient compilation error detection and resolution during development without complex configuration or verbose output.

## Current VContainer Migration

### Architecture Overview

The project is currently undergoing a systematic migration from Singleton pattern to VContainer dependency injection:

**Completed:**
- **RootLifetimeScope**: Global services (InputProvider, CursorConfiguration)
- **TitleLifetimeScope**: Title scene services (Credit, License, Version, GameSettings, Mouse services)
- **MainLifetimeScope**: Basic setup with Mouse services
- **Service Layer**: Interface-based service implementations
- **Component Integration**: SetMouseCursor with fallback manual resolution

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Service Lifetime Strategy**: 
   - `Singleton` for stateful services that should persist within their scope
   - `Scoped` for services that need to be recreated per scene (e.g., services referencing scene-specific GameObjects)

2. **Mouse Service Architecture**:
   - `VirtualMouseService` and `MouseCursorService` use `Scoped` lifetime
   - Ensures proper GameObject reference management across scene transitions
   - Each scene gets fresh instances that reference the correct scene's UI elements

3. **Fallback Resolution Pattern**:
   - Components like `SetMouseCursor` include manual service resolution as fallback
   - `FindChildLifetimeScope()` method excludes RootLifetimeScope and finds appropriate scene scope
   - Ensures robustness when automatic injection fails

**Migration Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Improved testability through interface-based design
- Centralized dependency configuration
- Proper lifecycle management for scene-specific resources
- Support for both MonoBehaviour components and pure C# services

**Future Migration Plans:**
- GameManager → IGameService
- MergeManager → IMergeService  
- InventoryManager → IInventoryService
- Progressive replacement of singleton pattern throughout the codebase
