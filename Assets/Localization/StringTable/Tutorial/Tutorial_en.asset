    m_Localized: You can merge balls by dropping a ball into the merge area and touching
      a ball of the same rank. The merged ball will disappear and a ball of the next
      higher rank will be generated in your inventory. The merged ball will activate
      an effect and attack the enemy, dealing damage calculated as ball attack power
      * ball rank * player attack power. If there is no ball of the next rank in
      your inventory, a new ball will not be generated. If there are too many balls
      and they touch the ceiling of the merge area, the ball will disappear and you
      will receive damage according to its rank.
